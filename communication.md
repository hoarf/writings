# Communication

So last review I tried to give you guys some practical advice on how to deal with communication errors. Back then, I told you that, in order to make sure that the other person understood what you meant, you should ask him to repeat back to you what you just told him.

This advice become a little meme for a while for a good reason. It's really obnoxious to repeat back what you just heard and the person you are talking to might even think you are mocking him.

But I decided to take the only advisable course when you became a meme. I'm going to double down on it and I am going to tell you a lot of other scientific facts about communication.

But first let's go back a little and try to define communication.

Communication is a way of `transmiting of information between agents.`

There are a lot of different ways to do that, but what most people understand by communication is Language Mediated Communication, or in other words, things that we say, that we write, that we record which are encoded in symbols.

Biologicaly speaking, language is a very recent adaptation. We are relativelly sure that most animals do not have language, at least not in the degree of sophistication that humans do. This raises the question, what is the purpose of communication?

The hypothesis that I'm going to discuss with you guys today is that LMC helps us humans to solve the `problem of shared knowlege vs commom knowledge.`

## Shared Knowledge

* A knows x
* B knows x

## Common Knowledge

* A knows x
* B knows x
* A knows that B knows x
* B knows that A knows x
* A knows that B knows that A knows x
* ...

You must be wondering: why is this relevant? 

In fact, this is a known problem from Game Theory. 

Imagine the following scenario:

There are two hunters who live on opposite sides of the forest: Munjal and Fernando. Every morning they face the choice of either hunting a small rabbit or hunting a large stag. The stag gives a much better reward but it requires that both of them coordinate and show up for the hunt togather.

Suppose that Munjal knows that the stag is in the woods today. This information is not enough for Munjal to be able to hunt it because Fernando also needs to know that the stag is in the woods today. Plus, Fernando needs to know that Munjal knows that the stag is in the woods today otherwise there is no point in him showing up.

Only common knowledge makes them showing up for hunting the stag something racional to do.

This is the reason why you will never see two monkeys coordinate to move a large log, for instance. Symbolic language helps because it's easily broadcastable and therefore it is ideal for turning shared into common knowledge.

## Most important fact about communication

The most important, number one, "if you need to remember one thing from this" kind of fact about communication is that `A LARGE PART OF COMMUNICATION IS NOT MEDIATED THROUGH LANGUAGE`

I'm gonna repeat that. `A LARGE PART OF COMMUNICATION IS NOT MEDIATED THORUGH LANGUAGE`

Right now, you guys are looking and me and hearing what I am saying, but my words are not the only thing being communicated right now. The clothes I am wearing, my body language, the way I speak, the kind of words I am chosing, the familiarity that you have or not have with the subject, the expectations you have about my behaviour, the conversations you might have had about me with somebody else. All of this things are factored in the information that are being exchanged. Most of this information bypasses your councious toughts and feed directly into your biases and sub-councious.

Nowdays in Western Culture there is a lot of emphasis placed on language, in my opinion, for two main reasons.

1. The influence of post modern analytical philosophers who place a lot of emphasis on language.

2. The ever greater participation of women in the job market. Women are consistenly better at language related tasks than man at pretty much every age bracket. So it's only natural that, as more women join the market place, more emphasis is put on it.

That is not to say that men don't have sophisticated ways of communicating. We do, but it tends to be slightly different.

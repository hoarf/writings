# A Dialethical View of Software Development.

No question plagues the mind of a caring developer more that the question of how to best organize and coordinate software development.
The agile manifesto was published more than fifteen years ago and its steadly losing it's status as a catchall answer for this very question.
Critics point out as evidence of it's flaws that it tends to generate a proliferation of manager types, besides an incessant stream of pointless meetings and a lot of bikeshedding.
However, the extent we can attribute these flaws to the methodology or to others factors like Price's law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price) is unknown.

As it is the case with any dieing ideology, the thing that tends to occupy its absence is a form of nihilism, a call for a complete lack of structure,
or extreme forms of subjectivism, where the developer become the sole arbitrer of the relevant questions, even tho the claims of uniqueness of your situation and the peculiarities of your project seem often overblown and exaggerated.
